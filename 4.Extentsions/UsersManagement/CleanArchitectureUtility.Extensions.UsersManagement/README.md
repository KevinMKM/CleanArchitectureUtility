Clean Architecture - Users Management Extension
The Users Management Extension integrates user management functionality into applications following Clean Architecture principles. This extension provides essential features such as user registration, authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and profile management, all while ensuring that the core business logic remains decoupled from external frameworks or services.
By leveraging the Clean Architecture pattern, the Users Management Extension ensures scalability, maintainability, and testability by separating concerns into clear, distinct layers.
