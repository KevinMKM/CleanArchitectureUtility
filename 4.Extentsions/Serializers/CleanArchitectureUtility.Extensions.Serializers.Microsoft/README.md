Clean Architecture - Microsoft Serializer Extension
The Microsoft Serializer Extension is designed to integrate Microsoft's JSON Serialization (using System.Text.Json or Newtonsoft.Json) into applications based on Clean Architecture principles. This extension provides a streamlined way to serialize and deserialize data models to and from JSON format, while keeping a clean separation of concerns between different layers of the application.
This extension simplifies working with JSON data and ensures that your application maintains proper encapsulation and decoupling, in line with the Clean Architecture principles.
