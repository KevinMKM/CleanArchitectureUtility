Clean Architecture - Serilog Registration Utility
The Serilog Registration Utility simplifies the integration of Serilog, a popular logging library, into applications following the Clean Architecture principles. This utility enables centralized, consistent, and flexible logging configuration and management, ensuring that logging concerns are properly separated from business logic, thus adhering to Clean Architecture best practices.
With Serilog at the core, the utility provides structured logging with support for various log sinks (e.g., file, console, Seq, Elasticsearch) and enables integration with other observability tools. It allows for easy configuration of log levels, enrichments, and output formats, ensuring that the application’s logging system is extensible, testable, and easy to configure.
